# What is uncertainty and how do agents deal with it?
#### Sussex University and RIKEN CBS
Human behaviour and decision-making are contingent to the uncertainty that an agent has regarding its environment. The world is a dynamic place and its properties are often too many to keep track of. How is an agent affected by unknown and ambiguous information? How can reliable behaviour emerge in the presence of uncertain stimuli?

This project tackles these and other questions by combining behavioural and theoretical studies of agents in uncertain conditions, aiming to build a series of increasingly complex experimental setups with direct mappings to how uncertainty, ambiguity and randomness have been modelled in estimation and control theory, psychology and neuroscience.
