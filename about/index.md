## The origins of Manuel
Manuel was born and bred in the Italian countryside. Lived in a tiny village (less than 1500 people) surrounded by vineyards for most his life. He became an accountant before realising that his place was not at a desk filling tax forms, then shifted to computer engineering and later approached research topics in artificial intelligence and cognitive science.

Interested in any formal, ideally mathematical, theory of life and/or cognition.

## The origins of life
He worked for a very brief period at <a href="http://eon.elsi.jp/"><b>EON</b></a> (ELSI Origins of life Network) at Tokyo Tech. There, he got into theories of the origins of life (Ool), with a special interest for proposals attempting to link Ool to information and control theory. For a brief overview: <a href="http://eon.elsi.jp/information-and-regulation-at-the-origins-of-life/"><b>blogpost for EON</b></a>. In his spare time: understanding what life is all about.

## The origins of cognition
He is interested in (minimal) models of cognition. Where does it come from and why does it look (evolutionary) advantegeous? His approach mainly entails trying to link basic definitions of cognitive processes, and in particular action and perception, to simple mathematical models of agent-environment systems. He is often claiming that an understanding of cognition will require a deep(er) grasp of life, and vice versa. He's not sure about the life-mind continuity thesis.
